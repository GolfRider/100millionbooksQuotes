### [Self-Reliance] - Ralph Waldo Emerson, 1841

To believe your own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men, — that is genius. 
Speak your latent conviction, and it shall be the universal sense;
for the inmost in due time becomes the outmost,— 
and our first thought is rendered back to us by the trumpets of the Last Judgment. 
Familiar as the voice of the mind is to each, the highest merit we ascribe to Moses, Plato, and Milton is, 
that they set at naught books and traditions, and spoke not what men but what they thought. 
A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, 
more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without notice his thought, because it is his.
In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts: they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty. 
Great works of art have no more affecting lesson for us than this. 
They teach us to abide by our spontaneous impression with good-humored inflexibility then most when the whole cry of
voices is on the other side. Else, to-morrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely 
what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another.


### [Brave New World Revisited] - Aldous Huxley, 1958
The really hopeless victims of mental illness are to be found among those who appear to be most normal. "Many of them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence, because their human voice has been silenced so early in their lives, that they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic does." They are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society. Their perfect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness. These millions of abnormally normal people, living without fuss in a society to which, if they were fully human beings, they ought not to be adjusted, still cherish "the illusion of individuality," but in fact they have been to a great extent de-individualized. Their conformity is developing into something like uniformity. But "uniformity and freedom are incompatible. Uniformity and mental health are incompatible too. . . . Man is not made to be an automaton, and if he becomes one, the basis for mental health is destroyed."


### [The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Medicine] - Huangdi, 2650 BC
If Yang is overly powerful, then Yin may be too weak. If Yin is particularly strong, then Yang is apt to be defective. If the male force is overwhelming, then there will be excessive heat. If the female force is overwhelming, then there will be excessive cold. Exposure to repeated and severe cold will lead to fever. Exposure to repeated and severe heat will induce chills. Cold injures the body, while heat injures the spirit. When the spirit is hurt, severe pain will ensue. When the body is hurt, there will be swelling. Thus, when severe pain occurs first and swelling comes on later, one may infer that a disharmony in the spirit has done harm to the body. Likewise, when swelling appears first and severe pain is felt later on, one can say that a dysfunction in the body has injured the spirit.
