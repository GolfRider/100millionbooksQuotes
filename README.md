### [Self-Reliance] - Ralph Waldo Emerson, 1841

To believe your own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men, — that is genius. 
Speak your latent conviction, and it shall be the universal sense;
for the inmost in due time becomes the outmost,— 
and our first thought is rendered back to us by the trumpets of the Last Judgment. 
Familiar as the voice of the mind is to each, the highest merit we ascribe to Moses, Plato, and Milton is, 
that they set at naught books and traditions, and spoke not what men but what they thought. 
A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, 
more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without notice his thought, because it is his.
In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts: they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty. 
Great works of art have no more affecting lesson for us than this. 
They teach us to abide by our spontaneous impression with good-humored inflexibility then most when the whole cry of
voices is on the other side. Else, to-morrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely 
what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another.


### [Brave New World Revisited] - Aldous Huxley, 1958
The really hopeless victims of mental illness are to be found among those who appear to be most normal. "Many of them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence, because their human voice has been silenced so early in their lives, that they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic does." They are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society. Their perfect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness. These millions of abnormally normal people, living without fuss in a society to which, if they were fully human beings, they ought not to be adjusted, still cherish "the illusion of individuality," but in fact they have been to a great extent de-individualized. Their conformity is developing into something like uniformity. But "uniformity and freedom are incompatible. Uniformity and mental health are incompatible too. . . . Man is not made to be an automaton, and if he becomes one, the basis for mental health is destroyed."


### [The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Medicine] - Huangdi, 2650 BC
If Yang is overly powerful, then Yin may be too weak. If Yin is particularly strong, then Yang is apt to be defective. If the male force is overwhelming, then there will be excessive heat. If the female force is overwhelming, then there will be excessive cold. Exposure to repeated and severe cold will lead to fever. Exposure to repeated and severe heat will induce chills. Cold injures the body, while heat injures the spirit. When the spirit is hurt, severe pain will ensue. When the body is hurt, there will be swelling. Thus, when severe pain occurs first and swelling comes on later, one may infer that a disharmony in the spirit has done harm to the body. Likewise, when swelling appears first and severe pain is felt later on, one can say that a dysfunction in the body has injured the spirit.

### [The Monkey Wrench Gang] - Edward Abbey, 1975

In clear-cutting, he said, you clear away the natural forest, or what the industrial forester calls "weed trees," and plant all one species of tree in neat straight functional rows like corn, sorghum, sugar beets or any other practical farm crop. You then dump on chemical fertilizers to replace the washed-away humus, inject the seedlings with growth-forcing hormones, surround your plot with deer repellants and raise a uniform crop of trees, all identical. When the trees reach a certain prespecified height (not maturity; that takes too long) you send in a fleet of tree-harvesting machines and cut the fuckers down. All of them. Then burn the slash, and harrow, seed, fertilize all over again, round and round and round again, faster and faster, tighter and tighter until, like the fabled Malaysian Concentric Bird which flies in ever-smaller circles, you disappear up your own asshole.

### [Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea] - Charles Seife, 2000
Zero is powerful because it is infinity's twin. They are equal and opposite, yin and yang. They are equally paradoxical and troubling. The biggest questions in science and religion are about nothingness and eternity, the void and the infinite, zero and infinity. The clashes over zero were the battles that shook the foundations of philosophy, of science, of mathematics, and of religion. Underneath every revolution lay a zero—and an infinity.

### [The Complete Essays] - Montaigne, 1572
We take other men’s knowledge and opinions upon trust; which is an idle and superficial learning. We must make them our own. We are just like a man who, needing fire, went to a neighbor’s house to fetch it, and finding a very good one there, sat down to warm himself without remembering to carry any back home. What good does it do us to have our belly full of meat if it is not digested, if it is not transformed into us, if it does not nourish and support us?

### [Between the World and Me] - Ta-Nehisi Coates, 2015
There is nothing uniquely evil in these destroyers or even in this moment. The destroyers are merely men enforcing the whims of our country, correctly interpreting its heritage and legacy. It is hard to face this. But all our phrasing—race relations, racial chasm, racial justice, racial profiling, white privilege, even white supremacy—serves to obscure that racism is a visceral experience, that it dislodges brains, blocks airways, rips muscle, extracts organs, cracks bones, breaks teeth. You must never look away from this. You must always remember that the sociology, the history, the economics, the graphs, the charts, the regressions all land, with great violence, upon the body.

### [The Power Broker] - Robert A. Caro, 1974
Hospitality has always been a potent political weapon. Moses used it like a master. Coupled with his over-powering personality, a buffet often did as much for a proposal as a bribe. "Christ, you'd be standing there eating the guy's food and drinking his liquor and get-ting ready to go for a ride on his boat, and he'd come up to you and take both your hands in his or put his arm around your shoulders and look into your eye and begin pouring out the arguments in that charming way of his and making you feel like there was no one in the whole world he'd rather be talking to—how could you turn the guy down?"

### [Great Leaders: Alfred Sloan] - New Word City, 2013
Perhaps most important, he respected facts, welcomed disagreement, and refused to make decisions until he was sure all the alternatives had been explored. Famously, he concluded one senior executive meeting by saying, 'Gentlemen, I take it we are all in complete agreement on the decision here." Around the table, all the heads nodded. "Then," Sloan said, I propose we postpone further discussion of this matter until the next meeting to give ourselves time to develop disagreement and perhaps gain some understanding of what the decision is all about."

### [The Rich Employee] - James Altucher, 2015  
When I worked at HBO I would try to get to work by about 6am every morning. Most people would come in around 10am. This was amazing for me. I had four hours of uninterrupted work time. In other words, by the time everyone else was just starting to arrive to work, I had already accomplished more than what most of them would do during the day.
PS: These days he writes little different :-)
 
 
 ### [The Mahabharata: A Modern Rendering] - Vyasa, 850 BC, (Modern Translation by Ramesh Menon)
"My lord, I have heard that the rishis say there is no death. Yet, even the Devas and Asuras take vows of celibacy to keep death away." 
"The wisest ones, who are truly free, say death is only ignorance. They say that where there is no ignorance, there is no death either. Death is not a beast that devours men. If a man's heart is clear, death will not approach him. If desire and anger do not sway a man, he does not die. Death is a form of ignorance. If a man kills desire at its first stirring, he need not fear death. Death is a materialization of the wrath and greed that possess an embodied soul. The man of wisdom will not meet this demon. 

Even as the body is destroyed when it dies, death itself is destroyed when faced with the light of knowledge."

### [The Prophet] Kahlil Gibran, 1923
Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself. They come through you but not from you, And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you. You may give them your love but not your thoughts, For they have their own thoughts. You may house their bodies but not their souls, For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams. You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you. For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday. 

You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth. The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far. Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness; For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.
   
### [Our Oriental Heritage] - The story of our civilization, Will Durant, 1935 
Since human skills and natural resources are diversely and unequally distributed, a people may be enabled, by the development of specific talents, or by its proximity to needed materials, to produce certain articles more cheaply than its neighbors. Of such articles it makes more than it consumes, and offers its surplus to other peoples in exchange for their own; this is the origin of trade. The Chibcha Indians of Colombia exported the rock salt that abounded in their territory, and received in retum the cereals that could not be raised on their barren soil. Certain American Indian villages were almost entirely devoted to making arrow-heads; some in New Guinea to making pottery; some in Africa to blacksmithing, or to making boats or lances. Such specializing tribes or villages sometimes acquired the names of their industry (Smith, Fisher, Potter . . .). and these names were in time attached to specializing families. Trade in surpluses was at first by an interchange of gifts: even in our calculating days a present (if only a meal) sometimes precedes or seals a trade. The exchange was facilitated by war, robbery, tribute, fines, and compensation; goods had to be kept moving! Gradually an orderly system of barter grew up, and trading posts, markets and bazaars were established occasionally, then periodically, then permanently—where those who had some article in excess might offer it for some article of need.



### [Poke the Box] - Seth Godin, 2011
I define anxiety as experiencing failure in advance ... and if you have anxiety about initiating a project, then of course you will associate risk with failure.

### [The Egyptian] - Mika Waltari, 1945
"Have your gods nothing to say about this? In other countries it is often they who determine what is right and what wrong." 
"Right and wrong? Right is what we desire, and wrong is what our neighbors desire. That is a very simple principle that facilitates both life and statesmanship and that in my opinion differs little from the teaching of the gods in the plains. As I understand it, these gods hold that to be right which the wealthy desire and that wrong which the poor desire."

### [Creativity, Inc] - Ed Catmull, Amy Wallace, 2009
While experimentation is scary to many, I would argue that we should be far more terrified of the opposite approach. Being too risk-averse causes many companies to stop innovating and to reject new ideas, which is the ?rst step on the path to irrelevance. Probably more companies hit the skids for this reason than because they dared to push boundaries and take risks—and, yes, to fail.
To be a truly creative company, you must start things that might fail.
